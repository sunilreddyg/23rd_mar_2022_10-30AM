
Entry Criteria for Test Execution:-->
	1. Unit and integration testing will be completed
	2. All testcase should be designed and approved
	3. Software installed into stagging servers[Local servers]
	4. Test environment should be established


	TestBed:--> Combination of test environment 
			and testcase is called TestBED


How they deploy software into test environment:-->

	=> After completed testcase reviews TestLead request for 
		software installation at testing environment.
	=> That means Software installation into local servers 
		[Stagging Server]
	=> Operational team deploy software into local servers 
		and request network and hardware  team to install 
		all dependent softwares into testing environment..
	=> Network team receive deployement document  [DD]

What Deployment Document Contains:-->

	=> What are the hardware and softwares to install in testing environment
	for Example:-->  
			1. Operating system  [WIN10]
			2. Browser	     [IE11]
			3. RAM 		     [8 GB]
			4. Database          [SQL]

	Note:--> After installation testing team need to check 
		all required softwares installed in testing envionment.
		If any softwares not installed testing team can 
		request to install before execution..

	=> Testing team receive "Release note" from 
		developement team

	=> What [Release note] or [Build note] contains:-->

		1. Document Version and approvals
		Release#1      [Build version and Names]
		Approved by ---[Name of the project manager]

		2. Hardwares and Softwares to install at 
		   Testing environment
						
			1. Operating system  [WIN10]
			2. Browser	     [IE11]
	Note:--> Here testing team need to verify all neccessary
		hardwares and software installed before execution.

		3. Site url or Local IP address
		http://192.168.1.23/OSM/Admin.v1.0
			
		4. Authentication details 
			
		Site usernames and Password
=================================================================================================>>
TestExecution:-->

	After completed software deployment process into testing environment. Testing team
	Testing team follow below levels of execution.

	Level-0 :--> Smoke Testing
	Level-1 :--> Comprehesive testing 
	Level-2 :--> Sanity Testing
	Level-3 :--> ReTesting
	Level-4 :--> Regression Testing
	Level-5 :--> Final regression testing

	Note:--> Above levels also known as functional testings


SmokeTesting:-->

	Smoke testing is a level-0 testing. Testing team conduct 
	smoke testing on every initial software. The main agenda 
	of smoke testing is to find stability of software.

	=> During smoke testing  testing team verify all important
	  functionalites working and are they any "showstopper"
	  defects available in software build.

	=> Incase testing team findout any showStopper defects
	   [High seviority  defects]immedietly testing team can  
	   suspend build and request new build to install in a 
           testing environment..

	=> Other name of smoke testing is "build verification testing"


When to Suspend build:-->
	=> Too many defects comming from inital builds.
	=> when user logout from the system    [Show stopper defect]
	=> when key functionality is not working
	=> Application crash 

Note:--> Because real testing conduct only on stable sofware.

	Q:->How long smoke testing will be conducted?
	Ans:--> Until application is stable


	Q:--> What is difference between build verification 
		and build Accetance
		
	build verification:--
		Testing condcut by testing team before accept
		software from developement

	build Acceptance testing:-->
		Testing condcut by the client team before accept
		software to install at client place.
	

Comprehensive Testing:-->

	=> comprehensive is level-1 testing ,Also knows as 
		System testing / Real testing

	=> During this test testing team execute every testcase 
		on Real Software.

	=> In this level testing team report defects to developement 
		team incase any mismatch find out in software 
		while execution fo testcase.


Execution steps:-->

	Precondition to follow by test engineer before execution fo testcase:-->

	Open all necessary documents before start your execution
	[Testcase, TestData, Release Note, TestPlan,FRS,BRS ---Any project document]


	1. Pick a Testcase  
	2. Read and Understand testcase
	3. Operate software and perform test steps according to testcase
	4. check actual result at real software, Then write acutal result at testcase document
	5. If actual result match with expected result It mean test pass, 
		when testpass we should write Testpass status with in 
		testcase document and continue testexecution for next testcase.

	6. If actual result mismatch with expected result we should change 
	   testcase status from NO-RUN to Testfail and report defect 
	   to developement team. 

	   Defect reporting tools --->[JIRA,QUALITYCENTER,Bugzilla,Yodiz---etc]

	7. Find dependent testcases for failure testcase, 
	   And change execution status from NO-RUN to NOT-COVERED

	8. Continue execution for next testcase.


The following activities should be taken care:
	1. Number of test cases executed.
	2. Number of defects found
	3. Screen shots of successful and failure executions should be 
		taken in word document.
	4. Time taken to execute.
	5. Time wasted due to the unavailability of the system.


	Note:--> During comprehensive testing. testing team report 
		 defects to developement team. And developent team 
		fix those defects and release new version of sofware 
		to testing team for further testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>>
Sanity Testing:-->
		Sanity testing also a build verification testing but 
		santity testing conducts on modified sofwares.

	=> During sanity testing testing team verify application
		stability after code modified from developement team.
	=> Testing on new bugs and New chanages with in software

	=> It is conduct on stable softwares after multiple rounds 
		of regression Testing.
		
=======================================================================================================
Retesting:-->
	
  To Ensure that the defects which we reported in previous build 
	were fixed or not in current build.

	For Example:-->
	=> Say  Build#1.0 was released and we posted some defects 
		to developement team
	=> developement team fix those defects and release new version 
		of software  Build#1.1 to testing team
	=> Testing Build#1.0 defects in Build#1.1 is called Retesting
======================================================================================================
Regression Testing:-->
		
	Repeating all failed and some of passed testcase on modified software.
	Here is the assumption when software modified to fix bugs it may 
	effect to existing software. And their is chance of new 
	defects invention.

how long the regression testing will continue:-->

     => Regression testing continues until all defects has been fixed


     Theory:-->When your are introducing something to software, 
		It means your are inventing new defects init.


	when we do regression testing:-->
		1. Any new requirement added to software
		2. Any changes in requirements  
		3. When Defects fix in exising software
		4. when browser version is upgraded
		5. When changes made in Database
		6. When Perform testing bugs fixed
		7. Any feature removed from webpage
		8. When user interfaceis updated
		


The following activities should be take care?.
	1. Un-covered testcase executon in previous build
	2. Testcases which are not coverd due to unavailability 
		of environment
	3. Testcase which is added newly


Note:--> Becuase regression testing is time taking due to this reason testing 
	team follow automation tools to perform regression repeatedly.
				
	Regression tools available in market:-->
			1. Selenium
			2. UFT
			3. RFT
			4. CodedUI
			5. Protractor
			6. Katalon Studio   
			7. Tosca
======================================================================================================
System Intergration Testing [SIT]:-->
	Also know  as component integration testing
	Othername of system testin is END to END testing

	=> Some times requirements are design to use in different state 
	   of software.Then testing team need to verify the requirement 
	   are functioning everywhere  where client expected it to be.

	=> checking a customer expecations are accomplished at entire
	    software 


	Note:--> Business analyst team design system integration testcase 
		 and ask testing team to execute testcase after 
		completed software testing by independent teams..
