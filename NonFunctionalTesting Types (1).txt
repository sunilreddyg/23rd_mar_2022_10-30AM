Non-Functional Testing:-->

	=> Non functional testing types verify how system
		performs.Inorder to run functional behavior ofsoftware

	=> Tester involve in non-functional testing using NFRS document
		[Non functional required specification document].

	=> After completed functional testing  testers involve in 
		non functional testing

	=> Organization recriut separate non functional testing team or 
	   provide traing for functional engineers inorder to condcut 
	   non functional testings

1.Usability Testing:-->
	During this test tester verify userfriendlyness of software

	Note:--> Tester verify software userfriendlyness using 
		below checklist

	1.Verify spelling in all screens of software
	2.Verify labels in it all screens of software
	3.Verify Meaning of labels in all screens of software
	4.Verify line spacing in label and control
	5.Verify line spacing in controls
	6.Verify location of controls which are functionality related
	7.Verify Home button in every screen of software
	8.Verify shortcuts in labels of screens
	9.Verify icon symbol meaning
	10.Verify icon tool tips
	11.Verify keyboard access on every screens
	12.Verify meaning of error
	13.Verify system menu existence in screens.(Minimize, Maximize, Restore, click….etc
	14.Verify color contrast of screens

===================================================================
2. Compatibily Testing:-->
	During this test tester verify browser and operating system 
	comptibility.Here test engineer verify whether software 
	is accessable and operatable with in client expected 
	browsers and operating systems.

	=> Other name of compatibility testing is cross browser testing 
		or cross platform testing [In real time organizations 
		use selenium kind of automation tools to conduct 
		cross -browser automation]	
======================================================================
3.Performance testing
	=> Performance is non functional testing 
	=> Performance testing only possible using automation tool like 
		[LoadRunner, Jmeter,Web load, Load ninza --etc]
	=> During this test performance testing engineers verify 
	   software speed  and response under customer expected configuration
	=> Performance testing can't conduct at over UI 
		[From the front pages]

	Performance testing can be conducted using below sub tests..
			1. Load Testing
			2. Stress Testing
			3. Spike Testing
			4. Endurance Testing

Loadtesting: 
	the execution of software under customer configaration and cutomer
	expected load(No of concurrent users) to estimate speed 
	in processing, is called load testing

Stress testing:
	the execution of software under cutomer configaration and more than
	customer expected load to estimate "peak load" is called stress testing

spike testing:
	Spike Testing is a type of software performance testing that 
	is done by suddenly increasing or decreasing the load on 
	the system or software application. The load is generated 
	by huge number of users and the behavior of the system 
	is observed.

Endurance testing:
	execution of software under cutomer configaration and more than
	customer expected load continously to estimate logvity and durability 
	is called endurance testing
============================================================================================
Scalability Testing:-->

	scalability test measures the system at the minimum and maximum 
	loads at all levels, including the software, hardware and database levels

	Load testing determines the point at which level the application 
	crashes, while scalability tries to identify the reason 
	for application crash and take steps to resolve the issue.

	In short, Load Testing helps to identify the performance 
	problems while scalability testing helps to identify if 
	the system can scale up to the growing number of users.

============================================================================================
Datavolume testing:
	During this test, testing team is operating software by 
	storing sample data to estimate capacity of the software 
	database.

	Database capacities are changing due to this
	reason testing team conduct data volume testing to 
	find the capacity of database in number of records.
============================================================================================
Intersystem testing:-->
	During this test, testing team verify our software is 
	sharing data and co-existing with other softwares.
	
	For Example:-->
		Flipkart,Amazon web applications allow payment option with differnet
		gateways like  [UPI,Netbanking,Creditcard/Debitcard  ---etc]


============================================================================================
Installation Testing:-->
	=> Installation testing conduct most commonly on Desktop softwares
	=> To conduct installation testing tester follow below steps 

	1.Verify set up program execute to start installation
	2.Verify friendliness of screens while installation
	3.Verify occupied space after installation
	4.verify Un install process
	5.Verify user can cancel installation any time..
	6.Verify installation asking accept license agreement.
	7.Verify re installation of software
	8.Verify installation will continue after Restart Computer
	9.Verify installation in different compatible operating systems
	10.Verify Next button is disabled until user select accept license agreement
	11.Verify installation accept minimize and maximize feature
	12.Verify time taking for installation
	13.Verify process bar showing accurate result during installation
	14.Verify installation completed message displayed 
	15.Verify Error dialog displayed incase of failure during installation
	16.Verify installation happend at required folder
	17.Verify application shorcut created at desktop
	18.Verify supporting parallel installation
	
=======================================================================
Recovery Testing:-->
	Recovery testing is performed in order to determine how quickly 
	the system can recover after the system crash or hardware 
	failure. It comes under the type of nonfunctional testing.
	Recovery testing done by the system networking  and hardware team.

==========================================================================
. Globalization Testing.
	Globalization is a process of designing a software 
	application so that it can be adapted to various languages 
	and regions without any changes.

	Internationalization (l18N):--> refer globalization

	Example:-->
		Amazon website allowed to access same interfaces 
		in India,UK,USA ----etc regions.

===========================================================================
Localization Testing (L10N Testing):
	Localization is a process of adapting globalization software 
	for a specific region or language by adding local specific components.

	1. Verify software available in local language.
	2. Verify local timezones are displaying.
	3. Verify Local maps displaying at software.
	4. Verify postalcodes are displayed according to local region.
	5. Verify Mobile Number with different country codes

Multy languity testing:
	some times developers are developing a s\w in java unicode or .net with
	unicode this type  of sofware provide output in differnt lanaguge and by
	taking input in one language.
==============================================================================
SecurityTesting:-->

	Finding vulnarable spots with in software. 
	It mean finding weak spots of software.

	In one word security testing means authorized user can get access 
	software, for unauthrized user prevent software access.


	1. Authorization
	2. Authentication
	3. Dataprotection
	4. SQL injection [Cross site scripting]
	5. Session Management
	6. ErrorHandling
	7. Access points
	8. Cookies 

	
Authorization:-->
	According to roles and responsibilites user able to access software.
	Also prevent invalid user to access software features.

	During this test testing team login into software with different
 	roles and check authorities available according to there 
	roles and responsibilities..

		=> What role is yours ?


	Example:-->
	In online video conference meeting only organizer have
	permission to record meeting. This access should be restricted 
	to attendies..

Authentication:-->
		=> Who you are?
		=> authorized access  is granted to protect data and 
		unauthorized access is restricted

		Example:-->
		Login authentication:-->
		 Only valid user can access software and features of it.
		for invalid user system restrict access ask to register 
		with software.

dataprotection:-->
	=> Also we can call as encryption and decryption testing
	=> Dataprotection testing can be done over userinterface and database.
	=> In userinterface testing team verify all account passwords are 
			restricting user to watch/copy.
	=> Virtual keyboards [During Banking Logins]

	How data protection tested in database:-->
	=> Testers send queries to read password of user and verify 
		data is saved in encrypted format.

SqlInjection:-->
	=> Also known as Cross site testing
	=> Testers verify site is accessing any malicious script inorder to  manipulate
	   software original behaviour..
	=> Mostly test conduct at input fields like [Editbox, Listbox ---etc]

	Example:-->
	=> Bank employees restricted to transfter ammount upto 20000.Then employee
	is trying to increase range by sending malicious script from user interface.

Security Testcases:-->

=> 1. Verify invalid credentials that cannot be entered less than 6
	characters and password should not be the same.

=> 2. Verify system should restrict accessing previous pages after 
	Sign out.
		
=> 3. Verify bookmarked pages asking to re enter authentication

=> 4. Verify bookmark option disabled on secured pages

=> 5. Verify system restricted user to view source

=> 6. Verify Right click option is disabled

=> 7. Verify your server lock out when individual who has tried to 
      Access a site multiple times with invalid user account.

=> 8. Verify system ask user to login again after timeout finished

=> 9. Verify preventing software access. when user try direct url entry 
      to access  secured pages.

=> 10. Verify the same account login at diff machines. [At a time only 
     one user login into system]

=> 11. Verify that error message doesn't contain malicious info so that 
	hacker can’t hack website.

=> 12. Verify input fields restrict html and xml tags injection.

=> 13. Verify data projected in database should display user passwords in 
	encrypted  format.

=> 14. Verify system restricted guessing passwords using hacking software
	 [brute force attack] [test with simple login with admin password]

=> 15. Verify software is  restricted to access from different portals when
        	 User have permission to access using single gateway.

=> 16. Verify cookies storing restricted on secured page
