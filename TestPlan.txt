	Test lead design test plan.It is a guideline docuemen to testing team..


	What you find in test plan?
		What to Test?
		Where to Test?
		How to Test?
		when to Test?

 Test plan ID: 
	The name of test plan document for future reference.
	for example :---> Testplan v1.0

 Introduction: 
	About corresponding project requirements or functionality

 Test items: 
	The names of all requirements or functionalities or modules in corresponding project.
		=> Admin Module [Creation, Updation,Delection]

 Feature to be tested: 
	The names of requirements or functionality to be test.
	[System Testing, API testing, DB-Testing ---etc]

 Feature not to be tested: 
	The names of tested requirements or functionality in corresponding project.
	[Performance Testing, UnitTesting, Integation Testing  --etc]
	=> Types of testings not part of your team.

 Approach: 
	The list of selected tests to be applied 
	 [Tests will be selected by Project Manager through test strategy].

 Test environment: 
	Required H/w and S/w to use in testing.  
	[Browser Name &  Browser version  &  Operating system]
	[Testenvironment will be setup before start system testing]

 Entry criteria: 
	[To start test execution]
 	Test cases prepared and reviewed after training sessions.
	Real test data received from client
	Test environment established by H/w team (computers S/w & H/w).
 	Received s/w build from developers.

Suspension criteria: 
	[To interrupt test execution]
	Test environment Problems (H/w problem)
	Software is not working.
	More defects are in pending by developers.

Resumption criteria:-->
	[When to resume suspended execution]
	After Environment Problemes fixed
	Previously reported defects has been fixed
	
Exit criteria: 
	(To stop test execution)
	All requirement in s/w are tested
	Test duration exceeded
	95% testcase passed
