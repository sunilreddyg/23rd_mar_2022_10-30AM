====================================>

System Testing:--->

	=> System testing done by QA team.
	=> During this test tester verify external 
	functionality of software.


System Testing is categorized into two types.
	1. Functional testing
	2. Non functional testing


Functional testing:-->
	=> During this testing Test-Engineer verify core 
		requirements of client at user interface.
	
	=> Checking customer exepectation is fulfilled
	   at end user level.

		1.Behavioural /GUI testing 
		2.Input testing
		3.Output testing
		4.Error handling
		5.DB-Testing [Backend testing]
		6.Links coverage


	1. Behavioural testing:-->
		During this test Test-Engineer verify availability of each screen
			and each screen response to End user.

	Graphical UserInterface Testing [GUI]

		During this test Test_Engineer verify look and feel of software
			from front page..
		
		=> Verify font sizes
		=> Verify color,Background color of elements
		=> Verify page alignments
		=> Verify images at page
		

	2.Input-Domain Testing:-->
		During this testing Test-Engineer verify whethere software is accepting
		valid inputs from end-user.
		
		=> Verify user can enter text into editbox
		=> Verify user can select input from Dropdown
		=> Verify user can select radio buttons
		=> Verify user can select checkboxes
		=> Verify user can use mouse and keyboard inputs at software.
		=> Verify user can select option from listbox
		=> Verify user can select date from datepicker
		=> Verify user can select multiple options from listboxes [Opitonal]
		=> Verify user can operate software using touch actions
		=> Verify user able to click buttons,links,selection items
		=> Verify user able to access sub categories by hovering on Main 
		categories
		
	3.Output-Domain Testing:-->

		During this testing Test_Engineer operate software 
		using valid credentials/inputs to verify 
		correctness of output.

		=> Typed characters visible at editbox
		=> All radio buttons and checkboxes genarating rules as expected
		=> verify Selcted dropdown option populated
		=> Selected date visible at calendar.
		=> Verify status messages displayed at webpage after operated 	
		   software with valid data.
		=> Verify Expected image/object/text available at webpage.
		=> Verify object visible and hidden  behaviour according to input entry
		=> verify object enable and disable behaviour according to input entry
		=> Verify checkbox and  radio button status after selection and deselection
		=> Verify expected popup messages display to convey status messages
		=> Verify expected data records are showing at webtables.
		=> verify child feature displayed after parent entry sucessfull

               4. Error handling:-->

		During this testing Test_Engineer operate software 
		with invalid inputs to verify software is
		preventing those actions and display appropriate
		error messages to end-user.


		=> Verify appropriate error message displayed on invalid data
		=> Verify popup message displayed on incorrect operations
		=> Verify info message displayed when order missing
		=> Verify error message displayed when Field leavy empty but it 
		   expected as mandatory field
		=> Verify table records show "Records not available" when user try emtpy search 
					or by missing required records
		=> Verify input entry at editbox when text box is in readable mode
		=> verify user actions on disable element
		=> verify click functionality of button  or link when object is inactive


	   5. Illegal handling:-->
		During this testing test engineer purposly hack software with illegral
		approach and verify whether sofware is preventing user to access.


		=> To many invalid attempts to access password
		=> Guessing passwords
		=> Bookmark a page after successfull login
		=> verify page not allowed user to access page source
		=> verify user able to take screenshot of page when it is not allowed
		=> Handle capcha using automation tools

	5. DB-testing:-->
		=> Also known as backend testing


	1. Data mapping:-->

	=> Also called as data validity
	=> Checking connection of new database tables and forms.

		verify that respective tables and records are 
		updated when the user clicks ‘Save’, ‘Update’, 
		‘Search’ or ‘Delete’ from GUI of the application.


	2. Data integrity:--->

		Consider that different modules (i.e. screens or forms) of 	
		application use the same data. In that case, 
		make it sure that the latest state of data is reflected 
		everywhere..


		Note:-->
		SIT-[System Integration Testing]
		System integrity or End-to_End System Integration testing
		done by functional testing team at user interface 
		of sofware.


		
	5.LinksCoverage:--->
	
		Links play keyrole in webapplicatons. To test links at webpage
		follow below checklist.

	=> Verify if any broken images and links at webpage
	=> Verify administrator links opening thirpardy tools.
	=> Verify all external links open page at private window.
	=> Verify all hyperlinks connect intersystem softwares..
	=> Verify secure pages opening in incognito window.
