TestData:-->

	=> Most of the cases Client provide test data to testing 
	  team,  before start test execution. 
	  But in some cases testing team prepare sample data according to 
	  special requirements.

	
	Que:--> How testing team know testdata specification:-->
			=> What kind of field?
			=> What range it accept?
			=> What is the object type?

	Ans:-->
		Testing team receive usercase document, This document contains 
		special requirements for each and every field..

	Que:--> what if special requirements not defined for any filed.
	
	=> Testing team also can retrieve test data from database. 
	    To retrieve testdata from databtase in market 
	    there are many data genarator tools are available.

	TOAD:--> Tools is used to pull testable data from database..


	Test Data available in two categories:-->

			1. Real Data
			2. Dummy Data

	RealData:-->
		=> Real data provided by the client before 
		   execution of your tests.
		=> Testing team also can retrieve data 
	           from production database.

		AccountNumbers:-->
			180023456789
			180032455879
		
		University Listbox:-->
			SV university
			JNTU university

		Emails and Passwords:-->[Valid Data]
			qadarshan@gmail.com
			Hello@12345
	
	DummyData:-->
				
	Testing team prepare dummy data inorder to test software 
	Fistname Entry :--[3-100][only Alphabets][Spaces allowed]

		Valid Data  :-->   abc,abcd----upto[100]

		InValid Data:-->   ab,abced----upto[101]


SqlInjection:-->
	Que : What If parent module is under construction and we 
	must take data from parent module inorder to test child modules.		
					
	=> Testing team can inject dummy testdata to database by executing
	      database statements.
	=> Using API's also we can inject real testable 
	      data to software

Testcase Reviews:-->

	After completed testcase designs, different people involve in testcase reviews

		1. Peer Review
		2. Lead Review
		3. Developer Lead Review
		4. Business Analyst/Project Manager Review

	Why testcase reviews:-->
		To ensure that each every functinality covered in 
		test designs.


	PeerReview:-->
		It is done by another test engineer who has't written those test case 
		but he/she is famililar with system or domain.
			
			1. Focus on spell mistakes
			2. Grammar mistakes
			3. Template format
			4. Any duplication of Testcases

		they write any remarks available in test design document.
		After that test engineer
		make changes in testcases and forward testcase to Testlead


	Lead Review:-->
		
		It is done by team supervisor or TestLead
			1. Functionality Coverage
			2. Guidelines
			3. Replications  --> Any duplication of testcase
			4. Unnecessary testcase  --> Removal of useless testcase

		
					
	Developer Lead:-->
		
	After complete testlead review. Testlead send testcase to developer lead.
	Then developer lead involve in below reviews.

	=> Are these testcase designs under guidelines of BRS and SRS document
	=> Are their any own preditction in testcase designs by the testing team
	=> Are testing team intrepreted any requirements to design testcase

	
	Business Analyst:-->
		=> Are these testcase manage to test all software features
		=> Are these testcase willing to test client features


	ProjectManage :-->
		Project manager give approvals to execute testcase
