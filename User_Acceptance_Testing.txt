user accetance test[UAT]:-->

		1. Alpha testing
		2. Beta testing

	
	Why UAT:-->
		Here accetance means approval of agreement.
		Client conduct this testing before software goto live.

	When UAT testing conduct:-->
			After system testing and before software go to 
			production.


	Alpha testing:-->
		It is a factory level testing. during this test organization form a team
		along with [Developers, Business analyst team, test engineers] and this
		team try to findout  QA team mistakes [Defect leakage].

		What consider in alpha testing?
				
			1. Is QA testing team coverd all test areas.
			2. Is QA team followed all bylaws to test software as 
				specified in document.

		How UAT testing conduct:-->

			Here entire team members execute acceptance testcase.
			These testcase developed by business analyst team or production team.

			
		second process:-->

			It is  a factory level testing. During this test organization invite client
			team to visit organization and ask to perform Quality Control test before
			software install into client place.

			Stage1:--> Once every developed requirement meet with customer expecation
				client team request to install software at production environment.

			stage2:-->Incase client team findout any leakages organization requrest
				 some more time for software release.



		Note:--> It is final testing  that is carried out before the software goes to live,
			 Obviously this is last chance entire system to test once before software 
			 release to production.


		DEVELOPMENT ---> QA  ----> UAT  ---> PRODCUTION



	Beta testing:-->

		Users or clients involve in beta testing. During this test client recruite industry
		experts to test software.

		=> This testing conduct by two diffent category people like 
				"Model users","Real users"

		Model Users:-->
			Model user includes [Marketing team, 
			Industry experts, buyers ----etc]
					
		what is QA team job here:-->
			We should train beta testing team.
			Production team also train beta testing users.

		End uses:-->
			Group of end users[people]
			Some times client release software to real 
			public as free Source.With intension to 
			findout defects with in software...
