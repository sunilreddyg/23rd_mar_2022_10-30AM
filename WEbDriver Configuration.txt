	=> It is desinged to automate browser interface
	
Features:-->
	=> Support CrossBrowser automation
		[Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Edge, IE]

	=> Support multiple languages to design programms
		[Java, Python, Ruby, .Net, Javascript  --etc]

	=> Support multiple operating systems to install software
		[Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris]
	
Advantages:-->
	=> WebDriver handle dynamic applications.
	=> WebDriver is a core API, Designed with Object oriented features.
	=> WebDriver support dynamic timegaps with Implict & Explicit advanced waits
	=> WebDriver had partial support on Alert handlings.
	=> Support mobile interface automation  [Appium]
	=> Support BDD framework [Behaviour developement driven]  [Cucumber]
==============================================================================================
Note:-->
	Because webdriver is a API, So it doesn't have interface
	to write and run autmation tests. To write and run automation
	tests first we need to setup environment.

		jar files  to  javaproject...
=========================================================================================================
Note:--> After completed required downloads follow below 
	 configuration to setup project....


WebDriver Configuration:-->

		=> Workspace store your projects.
		=> Create folder at any drive and name it as "selenium-workspace"
		=> Create sub folder and name it as "Selenium_libraries"
		=> Dump all selenium executable jar files into "selenium libraries" folder


2. Launch eclipse using above wokspace:-->

		=>Double click on Eclipse ICON
		=>Browser workspace and click ok button.
		=>For the first time we recieve welcome banner, Close welcome banner
			to reach workbench..

3. Create java project:-->

		=> Open Eclipse --> File Menu ----> Use New Option --->select project
			--> open java folder ---> Select javaproject --> Enter projectname
			---> click on finish..
		=> After project creation find it under package explorer.
		=> Expand project to watch default architecture of simple java project..

		ProjectName
			src
			JRE-SystemLibraries


4. Configure selenium libraries to java project:-->
		
		=> By adding these jar files we can design and execute selenium programs
		   under java project..

		=> Under project 
		--> Right click on JRE libraries 
		--> Select build path 
		--> and then select configure buildpath 
		=> It opens project properties window along with java libraries.
		=> Click [Add external Jars] button 
		=> And browser all selenium executable libraries..
